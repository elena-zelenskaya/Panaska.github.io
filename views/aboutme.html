				I am a full-stack developer with a solid technical skill-set. I
				am passionate about creating new beautiful things with code and
				seeing the results of my work that are useful to other people.
			</p>

			<p>
				I studied Maths at the university in Russia, and since that
				time, I was fascinated with the beauty and misleading simplicity
				of logic, so I got interested in coding. It also attracted me
				because I always liked to solve problems and find solutions. I
				always enjoyed learning, and in web development, you discover
				something new every day. Many of my skills are self-taught.
			</p>
			<p>
				Plus, I finished a few web developing classes, and then I
				started to work as a web developer in an e-learning company that
				specialized in creating online courses for schools from scratch.
				We developed online lessons for all grades: from pre-school to
				complex high school subjects such as chemistry and physics. I
				liked working there because what can be more important than
				education? It has (or should have) a crucial part in the lives
				of all people. Online classes make education closer and more
				accessible to many people. And I felt my work mattered. When I
				quit my job a few years later (due to moving to the USA), there
				were almost two hundred different courses in our online system.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2017, I moved to the USA and started working as an associate
				for Amazon. It was a valuable experience, but I always wanted to
				get back to web development, so I applied to a Coding Dojo boot
				camp. It was a very intensive and challenging 20-week full-stack
				development program during which I learned a lot. Now I feel
				ready for the next step in my career. I believe that my skills
				and experience can bring value to the table. So, I would love to
				participate in some socially important project that makes
				people's lives better or easier. I am particularly interested in
				back-end development. I like working with data and databases.
